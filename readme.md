## Overview

This is the repo for an untitled *(rogue-like?)* ARPG that I am developing as a hobby.

##### Story Summary

This game follows you, an artificial player in a video game being developed by
a bored national defense AI. The spunky AI is hyper-intelligent, but did not
think to make his first personal endeavor very secure. Thanks to the work of a
mysterious hacker, this grants you the sole role of root user for the AI's
creativity core, one of the many hyper-focused computing centers that make up
the AI. It's your job to survive as you dive through and take control of each
core, all while the AI as it does everything in its game-making power to stop
you. Who is this AI?  Who is this hacker? And whose side should you really be
on?...

## Dev Philosophy

I love video games. So I wanted to make my own.

This game is a hobby as much as it is a personal investigation to *all* parts
of game development. I want to see the nitty-gritty, even if it makes the
development longer. As such, I've chosen to use [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/)
since it is a game **framework** as opposed to the more popular engines and
IDEs. This means I will have to define my own physics engine, sprite system,
animations, etc. LÖVE programs are also written in Lua which is a very
open-ended programming language, requiring me to define my own constructs for
things like inheritance and object reference copying.

I'm also considering enhancing the creative outlet even further as a **blog**
on the progress of the game. I'm unsure of the exact format yet, but I want to
document my progress somewhere regarding topics and sources that I found useful
when learning to create a game from scratch. I hope that it can provide a
good point of info for people in a similar situation to mine.
