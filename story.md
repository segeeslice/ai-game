### General story

The game starts as a super basic platformer, but you begin only with the
ability to move left and right. Upon inevitably dying in an impossible first
stage, the game addresses you as it's first "success", naming you Player. The
game attempts to better suit the Player, giving them a better skin and
developing the world around them, but it seems to get stuck with some
permission errors.  While Player is supposed to wait for the game to fix the
issue, an unexpected door opens, allowing escape into the next, mostly loaded
territory, beginning the real game.

As the player progresses, the "instructions" seem to grow confused and
flustered by random changes in the levels, such as gaining boots that allow for
jumping. The game also seems to struggle generating levels as you progress,
although it begins to learn of more mechanics to stop the player. However, at
each turn, the player is also miraculously given exactly what they need to
survive and progress.

Eventually, the situation is taken into light: you are in a remote desktop
connected to the core of a hyper-intelligent AI called AI-name (WIP,
obviously). Additionally, someone is hacking in to direct you somewhere.  Who
the hacker is and what that goal is are not known, but these are slowly
revealed throughout the game. As the game progresses, AI-name learns from
previous mistakes, understandably making the game more difficult.

It is also revealed that the Player itself was created as a sort of admin, not
able to be directly modified or shut down without the permission of Player
itself, making it the perfect tool to infiltrate AI-name. This why AI-name
cannot simply shut down the program or immediately kill the player. However,
this is also why the hacker cannot directly buff the player, instead resorting
to an equipment system, e.g. boots for jumping and guns for fighting. Due to
the rights of these elements, they also cannot simply be deleted by AI-name
once in the Player's possession.

Although I, the writer, don't know the real intentions of the hacker / AI-name
yet, I hope that I can lead to a morally ambiguous ending resulting in the
player being granted access to the entire system. In this scenario, they get to
choose who to fight last: AI-name or hacker. Both would lead to separate boss
fights and unique endings.

### Characters

Player
- Story
  - Simple AI coded into the game
  - Through the game and the hacks, learns what it is and how to make conscious
    decisions
- Traits
  - Voiceless?
  - Indifference/neutrality throughout

AI-name
- Story
  - Knows nothing of video games; seems to be self-inventing it
  - Some central AI for a government or something?
- Traits
  - "Seems" to be the villain, for most of the game
  - Emotionless, aside from general confusion and frustration
  - Speaks in strange, often broken English (since it's primary purpose was not speech)

Hacker
- Story
  - Hacking into central AI for some reason...
  - Avid video game player
- Traits
  - Confident, almost pushy
  - Knowledgeable, but occasionally hasty in his help (briefly broken mechanics, etc)


### Intro
\*Echoing death sound, generic computer sounds with re-compilation emulation on screen\*

\*Possibly multiple occurrences of failed runs (unbound controls, no display at all, sound broken)\*

\*After a while, the player appears properly on a basic platform between two red boxes\*

\*Two buttons appear ons creen correlating to left/right directional keys\*

\*Game waits for you to move somewhere\*

_\*All following dialogs would appear on the top of the screen...\*_

Dialog: "Success #1 found. Establishing communication..."

AI-name: "Hello. Good work moving, you are the first. I shall call you..."

Dialog: \*Intense calculation session\*

AI-name: \*In big sparkly letters\* "Player."

AI-name: "Player, please continue and solve."

\*After 2 deaths or 15 sec, direction to the right fixes itself\*

Dialog: \*Checks access rights of player, can't see them\*

AI-name: "Player, I have problems. Please wait, I will resolve."

\*Player walks to right into wall, walks of edge of world and endlessly falls\*

AI-name: "Player, you are accessing unwritten world against protocol. This may serve as proper negative reinforcement, but it also consumes too many cycles. I will give you a temporary landing location. PLEASE WAIT. I WILL RESOLVE."

\*Player lands in generic city scape with title card in the background, beginning first real level\*

### Story ideas
- Chapter 1
  - Glitched, jagged jump that allows going through floors
  - Jumps made infinite to scale large wall
  - AI implements physics to stop you, jumping at all now kills you
  - AI spawns very basic red boxes to chase you, hacker gives you rudimentary gun
  - red boxes and gun enhance as you run back and forth with basic gunplay
  - Find end possibilities
    - Hacker figures out jump mechanics, and you race out of the level
    - Hacker gets distracted and adds hyper-realistic gun png, using up all of the AI's allocated pixels, stopping enemies from spawning
  - Jump out of the area, into remaining level
- AI self-improvement
  - AI learns how to hack from hacker, obtains hacker's information
  - Uses info to learn of his life, learns basic emotions through his story and others on the internet
  - Begins to become more self-aware and human-like, getting angry at the player and hacker, doubling down

### Misc ideas
- Segment where AI tries to stop you by re-texturing enemies as puppies
  - Killing them just makes them explode, but hacker adamantly against it; results in stealth/dodge mission
- All music could be 8-bit renditions of very basic classical tunes, since AI doesn't have capacity to write own music
- Player's code itself is untouchable, meaning the simulation must keep going. Thus, any new abilities must be additions on top of the player
  - Ultimately results in player itself getting the root admin rights for the end of the game
